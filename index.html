                <p>
                    In 2023, I made ten posters. They’re very silly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In search of a creative exercise, I set out to design some good looking – or at the very least interesting looking – posters in limited time. There’s no denying this project was inspired by Elliot Ulm’s work and process and XKCD’s jokes. Every poster was to be unique and distinct, but all are still connected by recurring elements. Other than that, the only limits were the number of colours my printer could faithfully reproduce (1, black) and the size of a sheet of A4 paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, that all sounded too smart. The truth is that I started out with only one design and no plan, until people asked for another. Craving some design work but not wanting to repeat the concept, I set out to continue the line of ugly, nonsensical posters. The posters soon got less ugly, but the urge to cover a university building with posters was too strong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scroll down to see the posters.<br>They get better after the first few, I promise…

                <h2>Today's Gender of the Week</h2>
                <p>
                    So, this is the one that started it all… 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One morning I found a website with a peculiar user interface for generating a username. Presumably in an attempt to tame the creativity of teenage students, the website forced me to pick a combination of two words from preselected lists and number to create a unique username. I felt limited by the options, but at the same time it was weirdly expressive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It made me think of the many “bad gender forms” that have been shared on social media. This one wouldn’t be much better than any of those, but <em>SunflowerDetective25</em> is at least a lot more fun than the traditional options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike this poster, gender is anything but black and white and there’s a lot of fun to be had. What better way to celebrate this than with an extremely silly design?

                <h2>Vegetable of the Year 2023</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s a lot of talk about meat and dairy lobbyists forcing their produce into our diets, but why is no one pressuring politicians to make us eat our veggies? Where is the broccoli lobby?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you start complaining, consider this. Some very reasonable definitions of the word “vegetable” include any edible part of a plant, so all fruits are actually also vegetables! If that makes you angry, please refer to the previous poster for my thoughts on overly restrictive definitions.
